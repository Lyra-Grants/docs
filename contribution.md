# Contributors Guide

Lyra is a dApp enabling derivates trading with infinite liquidity. We're community driven and welcome all contribution. We aim to provide a constructive, respectful and fun environment for collaboration.

If you wish to help out, please first join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/lyra) `#build-on-lyra` channel. For more information, see [grantsDAO](#grantsDao) below.

This guide is geared towards beginners. If you're an open-source veteran feel free to just skim this document and get straight into crushing issues.

## Why Contribute

There are many reasons you might contribute to Lyra. For example, you may wish to:

- contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem.
- establish yourself as an Ethereum developer.
- work on cutting-edge technology.
- learn how to participate in open-source projects.
- expand your software development skills.
- flex your skills in a public forum to expand your career
  opportunities (or simply for the fun of it).
- grow your network by working with fellow Ethereum developers.

## How to Contribute

Regardless of the reason, the process to begin contributing is very much the same. We operate like a typical open-source project operating on GitHub: each repository has an issues tab where we track what needs to be done and the pull request tab is where code gets reviewed. We use [Discord](https://discord.gg/lyra) to chat and coordinate work to community members.

The grantsDao has been created specifically to foster open community development and reward community developers. It is an essential piece in our collaborative effort to fully decentralize Lyra.

Be welcome to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/lyra) and locate the `#build-on-lyra` channel.


### General Work-Flow

We recommend the following work-flow for contributors:

1. **Apply to Collaborate on an existing Grant or propose a new Grant** before you start work communicate your intentions and ask questions.
2. **Work in a feature branch** of your personal fork (github.com/<YOUR_NAME>/<LYRA-PROJECT>) of the repository you wish to work on.
3. Once you feel you have addressed the issue, **create a pull-request** to merge your changes in to the main repository. In case of any doubts, don't hesitate to contact the grantsDao or ask away in the channel.
4. Wait for a grantsDao or auditor to **review your changes** to ensure the issue is addressed satisfactorily. Optionally, mention your PR on [Discord](https://discord.gg/lyra).
5. If the issue is addressed the repository maintainers will **merge your pull-request** and you'll be an Lyra official contributor!

  
There's a great [guide](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) by Rob Allen that provides much more detail on each of these steps, if you're having trouble. As always, jump on [Discord](https://discord.gg/lyra) if you get stuck.

## FAQs

### I don't think I have anything to add

There's lots to be done and there's all sorts of tasks. You can do anything from correcting typos through to writing core application code. If you reach out, we'll include you.

### I'm not sure my programming level is good enough

We're open to developers of all levels. If you create a PR and your code doesn't meet our standards, we'll help you fix it and we'll share the reasoning with you. Contributing to open-source is a great way to learn.

### I'm not sure I know enough about Ethereum

No problems, there's plenty of tasks that don't require extensive Ethereum knowledge. You can learn about Ethereum as you go.

### I'm afraid of making a mistake and looking silly

Don't be. We're all about personal development and constructive feedback. If you make a mistake and learn from it, everyone wins.

### I don't like the way you do things

Please, make an issue and explain why. We're open to constructive criticism and will happily change our ways.
